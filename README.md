# Finly: A Digital Finance Application  

## Introduction  

In the ever-evolving world of financial technology, building a digital finance application offers a tremendous learning opportunity. I embarked on this project to enhance my skills in JavaScript while exploring the intricacies of managing financial workflows.  

To achieve this, I chose **Next.js** as the framework for its powerful features and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The goal was not only to build a functional application but also to understand the architecture and operations behind digital financial platforms.

## Core Functionalities  

### 1. Send Money to Someone  
Users can send money to others. The process involves:  
- Verifying recipient details and sufficient balance.  
- Logging transactions in the database.

### 2. Withdraw Balance (Merchant or User)  
Merchants or users can request withdrawals, which are:  
- Verified by the backend.  
- Processed through the bankâ€™s API.  
- Updated via webhooks upon success.  

### 3. Webhooks for Incoming Transfers  
When users deposit money, bank webhooks notify Finly:  
- The backend validates the webhook and updates user balances.  
- Real-time updates ensure seamless experience.
